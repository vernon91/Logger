A plug-in used in KanColleViewer (KCV) to log info and results in .csv files

Logger source code from [@Yuubari](https://github.com/Yuubari/KanColleViewer/tree/logger/Plugins/Logger)


**Original Functions**:

Mini personal project just for learning purposes while adding the additional functions that I need which is missing from [@Yuubari](https://github.com/Yuubari/KanColleViewer/tree/logger/Plugins/Logger)
